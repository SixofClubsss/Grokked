# Grokked
Goal of the game, don't be Grok.

Written in Go and using [Fyne Toolkit](https://fyne.io/), Gokked is a proof of attention game built on Dero's private L1. Powered by [Gnomon](https://github.com/civilware/Gnomon) and [dReams](https://github.com/dReam-dApps/dReams), the goal of the game is simple. Don't get caught being the Grok. Players can join existing Grokked games, or deploy their own Grokked SC and run games with their preferred preferences. All Grokked SCs are tied into dReams ratings system.

The game starts with a player being randomly selected as the Grok. If that player doesn't prove they are paying attention by interacting with a SC (passing the Grok) within a certain time frame, they are removed from the game and a new player becomes the Grok. Each time a player is removed or passes the Grok, the time frame shrinks meaning players have to pay closer attention if they don't want to be removed from the game. SC's tally wins on chain for a global leader board. The owner of the SC facilitates removing players from the game, if the owner is not paying attention any player can Grok the owner meaning all players get a win on the board and a share of the pot.
